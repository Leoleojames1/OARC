# OARC - DivisorWaveMathematics - TODO build calculator tooling

1. add plotting software for latex formula, based on my divisor wave product 
repo without matplotlib, keep numpy

2. migrate old divisor wave plotting to new ARES-numpy product based plotting
    - replace numpy products with ARES based product series matrixe expansions

3. allow for in chat plots with latex, allow OARC to use plots as a tool

4. allow oarc agents to use direct calculator + - * / and other operators, 
build the utils of the graphing calculator such that the adequite tools calculator
can boost the oarc agent when in latex mode math logic mode.
