 Can you explain me how Doom Graphics worked?
-----------------------

LLM Response:
The graphics of the original Doom (1993) and its sequel, Doom II (1994), were a significant departure from the traditional 2D graphics that dominated the gaming industry at the time. Developed by id Software, these games pushed the boundaries of what was possible on computer hardware.

**The Technical Background**

In the early 1990s, the graphics processing units (GPUs) available in computers were relatively simple and limited in their capabilities. The most common type of GPU used at that time was the VLSA (Video Lamp-Switch-Associated), which was a monochrome display device that produced a series of static images on a screen.

To create more complex graphics, id Software turned to a combination of hardware and software techniques. They used a technique called "direct3D," which allowed them to render 2D textures onto the screen using 3D models.

**Direct3D**

Direct3D is a low-level API (Application Programming Interface) that provides a platform-independent way for developers to create 3D graphics on Windows platforms. id Software's DirectX implementation of Direct3D was used in Doom and its sequel.

The key concept behind Direct3D is the "device" class, which represents an OpenGL-like interface between the graphics card and the CPU. The device class provides a set of functions for accessing various graphics-related resources, such as textures, buffers, and vertices.

**Texture Mapping**

One of the most innovative features of Doom's graphics was texture mapping. Texture mapping allowed developers to apply different colors or patterns to 2D pixels (e.g., tiles on the screen) using 3D models. This technique was achieved by loading 3D models into memory, and then rendering them onto a 2D surface using the device class.

The texture maps were stored in the form of texture buffers, which were essentially arrays of color values for each pixel. The device class provided functions to access these texture buffers and manipulate them as needed.

**Frame Buffer**

Another important aspect of Doom's graphics was the use of a frame buffer (FB). The frame buffer is a temporary storage area that holds 2D pixels while they are being rendered onto the screen. In Doom, the frame buffer was used to store the accumulated textures for each vertex.

The frame buffer was typically a VLSA-like display device that produced static images on a screen. However, id Software's use of Direct3D allowed them to render the frames onto the screen in real-time, using the GPU to compute the 2D texture values as they were being rendered.

**Rendering**

To render the game, id Software used a combination of techniques, including:

1. **Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs)**: VBOs were used to store vertex data (e.g., 3D positions and colors) for each pixel on the screen.
2. **Index Buffers**: Index buffers were used to specify which vertices should be rendered as part of a single fragment.
3. **Fragment Rendering**: Fragment rendering involved computing the final color values for each pixel based on the texture coordinates, vertex data, and index buffer information.

**Graphics Pipeline**

The graphics pipeline was a critical aspect of Doom's architecture. The pipeline consisted of several stages:

1. **Vertex Processing**: Vertex processing involved transforming 3D vertices into screen space.
2. **Index Mapping**: Index mapping specified which vertices were rendered as part of a single fragment.
3. **Fragment Rendering**: Fragment rendering computed the final color values for each pixel.

The graphics pipeline was implemented using Direct3D, with additional logic to handle tasks such as texture loading and indexing.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, Doom's graphics were a remarkable achievement in their time, leveraging the power of direct3D to create 2D textures onto the screen. The use of vertex buffer objects, index buffers, and fragment rendering allowed for efficient and real-time rendering of complex graphics scenes. While the technology was far ahead of its time, it paved the way for modern computer graphics and continues to influence game development to this day.
