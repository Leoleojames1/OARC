# OARC - DivisorWaveMathematics - TODO: Build Calculator Tooling

1. Add plotting functionality for LaTeX formulas based on the divisor wave product repository.  
    - Avoid using Matplotlib; retain NumPy for computations.

2. Migrate the old divisor wave plotting system to the new ARES-NumPy-based plotting approach.  
    - Replace NumPy products with ARES-based product series matrix expansions.

3. Enable in-chat plotting for LaTeX formulas, allowing OARC to utilize plots as a tool.

4. Develop a direct calculator utility supporting operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and others.  
    - Enhance the graphing calculator utilities to empower OARC agents in LaTeX math logic mode.
