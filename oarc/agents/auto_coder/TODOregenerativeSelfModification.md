### Coding Agent for Regenerative Self-Modification

This document outlines the implementation of a class that imports the coding agent utilities. The purpose of this class is to construct a coding agent capable of:

- Being tasked with building new functionality.
- Integrating the new functionality into the OARC system.

The defined task is passed through `kwargs`, enabling this method to be invoked in various contexts.
