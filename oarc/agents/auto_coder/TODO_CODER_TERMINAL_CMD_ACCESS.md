# TODO: Implement Terminal Command Access for Auto Coder

This document outlines the steps to enable terminal command access for the Auto Coder agent. The goal is to allow the agent to execute terminal commands securely and integrate the results into the OARC system.

## Features to Implement
1. **Command Execution**:
    - Use Python's `subprocess` module to execute terminal commands.
    - Capture both `stdout` and `stderr` for logging and debugging.

2. **Security Measures**:
    - Sanitize input to prevent command injection.
    - Restrict the commands that can be executed by defining an allowlist.

3. **Integration with OARC**:
    - Store command results in the OARC database using `PandasDB`.
    - Enable interaction with the `FlagManager` for dynamic state updates.

4. **Async Support**:
    - Implement asynchronous command execution using `asyncio` for non-blocking operations.
